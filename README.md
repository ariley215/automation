1. Automate the creation of a folder.*completed 02-02-2024 10:25PM EST*

1. Handle a deleted user.*completed 02-02-2024 10:25PM EST*

- user2 is a deleted user and need to move their documents from their user folder to a temporary folder. Your script will create the temporary folder. This will effectively delete the user from the system while still maintaining a record of their documents.

1. Sort documents into appropriate folders.*completed 02-02-2024 10:25PM EST*

- Go through a given folder and sort the documents into additional folders based on their file type.
  - Move log files into a logs folder. If a logs folder doesn’t exist, your script should create one.
  - Move email files into a mail folder. If a mail folder doesn’t exist, your script should create one.

1. Parse a log file for errors and warnings.*completed 02-02-2024 10:25PM EST*

- From the previous task, you’ve moved a log file into the logs folder. Now, parse the log file for errors and warnings and create two separate log files in a target directory:
  - errors.log: Contains all error messages.
  - warnings.log: Contains all warning messages.

1. Create a menu-driven application.*completed 02-01-2024 11:25PM EST*

- Give the user a list of automation tasks (1-4) and let them choose one to execute. Customize your application by incorporating an additional automation task, choose one:
  - Counting the number of specific file types in a directory.
  - Renaming files based on a specific pattern.
  - Automatically backing up specific folders.
